## Manual Testing Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Run the migration:
\`\`\`bash
# Apply the migration (this should be done automatically in production)
# The migration file: supabase/migrations/20250924070000_add_note_to_self_conversations.sql
\`\`\`

### 2. Test New User Registration
1. Create a new user account
2. Verify that a "Note to self" conversation appears automatically at the top of the sidebar
3. Check that the conversation has special styling (blue gradient, note icon)

### 3. Test Existing User Migration  
1. Check that existing users now have a "Note to self" conversation
2. Verify it appears at the top of their conversation list
3. Confirm it has the correct styling and icon

### 4. Test Messaging Functionality
1. Click on "Note to self" conversation
2. Send yourself a message
3. Verify the message appears correctly
4. Check that the conversation preview updates in sidebar

### 5. Test Archive Prevention
1. Right-click on "Note to self" conversation - should not show context menu
2. Try to archive via API - should return 403 error
3. Verify "Note to self" never appears in archived conversations view

### 6. Test UI Integration
1. Verify "Note to self" always appears first in conversation list
2. Check special styling is applied correctly
3. Confirm empty state shows "Tap to add a note to yourself"
4. Test conversation selection and message input work normally

### 7. Test Persistence
1. Reload the page - "Note to self" should still be at top
2. Log out and log back in - should persist
3. Switch between archived/active views - "Note to self" stays visible

### Expected Behavior Summary:
- ‚úÖ "Note to self" conversation automatically created for all users
- ‚úÖ Always appears at top of conversation list with special blue styling
- ‚úÖ Cannot be archived, deleted, or right-clicked
- ‚úÖ Functions like a normal conversation for messaging
- ‚úÖ Shows helpful placeholder when empty
- ‚úÖ Persists across sessions and page reloads
